    // STEP 1: Create a NEW 'Test' object in a NEW 'Test.java' file (details below)
    /*
     * Details about the TEST object
     * Feel free to CUT/COPY/PASTE these directions into your NEW file
     * 
     * Create (construct) a new Test object that will:
     *     1) ask the User some (simple) questions (like "what color is the sky?")
     *     2) check their answers
     *     3) print out a grade based on their passing percent
     * 
     * All variables should be PRIVATE
     * variables: 1. String array questions[]   => that holds 2+ questions for your "Test"
     *            2. String array answers[]     => that hold the RIGHT answers for your "Test"
     *            3. String array answersUser[] => that WILL hold 2+ answers for your "Test"
     *            4. int score                  => that holds the total number of correct answers
     *            5. double grade               => that holds the User's grade percentage
     * 
     * All methods should be PUBLIC
     * methods:   1. askQuestions( Scanner ) that will:
     *                a) accept a Scanner object from the main program
     *                b) loop through the questions (use a FOR loop)
     *                c) ask them to the user
     *                d) read in user input
     *                e) store the user input in the answers[] array
     *            2. chkAnswers() that will:
     *                a) loop through the answersUser[] array (use a WHILE loop)
     *                b) compares each answersUser[] with answers[] (use IF/ELSE)
     *                    i)   IF correct (the same), add 2 POINTS to their score
     *                    ii)  ELSE IF correct but the wrong case (upper/lower), add 1 POINT to their score
     *                    iii) ELSE (incorrect), SUBTRACT 1 point from their score
     *            3. double calcGrade() that will:
     *                a) RETURN a typecast (double) value of their score
     *                b) divide the total score by the number of questions[] to find this
     *            4. printGrade( double ) that will:
     *                a) accept a numeric score (percent)
     *                b) use a SWITCH statement to RETURN 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F' based on the score
